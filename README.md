# Obsidian Callout Tasks
An alternative to create, track, and link tasks in Obsidian.md.

## Wishlist
- [x] Native to Obsidian, no plugins.
- [x] Title, Custom Metadata, Description.  
- [x] Collapsable details.
- [x] Internal links (wiki-links)
- [x] Metadata on a seperate line than title.  
- [x] Formatted for use with lists.
- [x] Infinite nesting with lists.
- [x] Custom colors and status icons. 

## Drawbacks
- ❌ Cannot be queried like Obsidian Tasks.
- ❌ Requires a space between a task description and its metadata. (Already done in the template)
