# Obsidian Callout Tasks
An alternative to create, track, and link tasks in Obsidian.md.

![preview](Obsidian%20Tasks%20Examples%20Preview.png)

## Installation
1. Copy both `.css` files from the `.obsidian/snippets/` directory into your Obsidian vault’s `.obsidian/snippets/` folder.
2. Use the provided template, or refer to the examples for setup guidance.

Since this uses Obsidian’s callout system, metadata is not required.
However, if you choose to use metadata, it can be anything (text, emojis, etc.) just make sure it’s placed inside the provided `<div>` element.

## Wishlist
- [x] Native to Obsidian, no plugins.
- [x] Title, Custom Metadata, Description.  
- [x] Collapsable details.
- [x] Internal links (wiki-links)
- [x] Metadata on a seperate line than title.  
- [x] Formatted for use with lists.
- [x] Infinite nesting with lists.
- [x] Custom colors and status icons. 

## Drawbacks
- ❌ Cannot be queried like Obsidian Tasks.
- ❌ Requires a space between a task description and its metadata. (Already done in the template)
